We cannot conclude that the RIO functionsi are explicitly reentrant because they take
pointers as arguments, and we cannot verify without analyzing the function calls
that these pointers do not point to shared variables that could be incorrectly
modified by different threads.

With that said, these functions are implicitly reentrant in that there are no local
shared variables that we can immediately see, but there could be shared variables
pointed to by arguments passed as pointers. It would then be up to the user of these
functions to ensure that shared variables are not passed through the pointer arguments
and that the functions are indeed reentrant when necessary.
