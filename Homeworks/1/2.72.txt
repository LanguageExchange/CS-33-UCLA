A) Because sizeof(val) returns a value of type size_t, an unsigned type, the operation maxbytes-sizeof(val) will undergo unsigned arithmetic, meaning that it will always return an unsigned (positive) number and that the condition will therefore always evaluate to true. 

B) To prevent unsigned arithmetic, we can cast the value of type size_t to a signed type.
if (maxbytes - (int) sizeof(val) >= 0)
